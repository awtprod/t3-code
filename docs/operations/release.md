# Release Checklist

This document covers the unified release workflow for stable and nightly desktop releases.

## What the workflow does

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - push tag matching `v*.*.*` for stable releases
  - scheduled nightly check every three hours
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` with an explicit `validate` or `publish` mode
- Runs quality gates first: lint, typecheck, test.
- Reads the shared production T3 Connect relay URL and Clerk client configuration before packaging clients.
- Builds four artifacts in parallel for both channels:
  - macOS `arm64` DMG
  - macOS `x64` DMG
  - Linux `x64` AppImage
  - Windows `x64` NSIS installer
- In `validate` mode, retains one consolidated signed artifact bundle for 14 days without publishing
  npm, GitHub Releases, Vercel deployments, tags, aliases, or version commits.
- In `publish` mode, publishes one GitHub Release with all produced files.
  - Stable tags with a suffix after `X.Y.Z` (for example `1.2.3-alpha.1`) are published as GitHub prereleases.
  - Only plain stable `X.Y.Z` releases are marked as the repository's latest release.
  - Nightly runs are always GitHub prereleases and never marked latest.
  - Automatically generated release notes are pinned to the previous tag in the same channel, so stable compares to the previous stable tag and nightly compares to the previous nightly tag.
- Includes Electron auto-update metadata (for example `latest*.yml`, `nightly*.yml`, and `*.blockmap`) in release assets.
- Generates `SHA256SUMS.txt` and validates every updater-manifest file path and byte size before publication.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `@awtprod/command-center`) with OIDC trusted publishing from the same workflow file:
  - stable releases publish npm dist-tag `latest`
  - nightly releases publish npm dist-tag `nightly`
- Deploys the hosted web app to the dedicated `awtprod-command-center` Vercel project only after a
  release is published. Stable releases update its production `vercel.app` domain; nightlies retain
  the generated preview deployment URL.
- Stable versions, including validation runs and prereleases, fail closed unless macOS and Windows signing
  configuration is complete. Pre-release and nightly builds may be unsigned only when no partial
  signing configuration is present.

## Required release credentials

Stable releases require these GitHub Actions secrets in addition to the platform and deployment
credentials documented below:

- `RELEASE_APP_ID`
- `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

The finalize job uses them to commit and push aligned package versions to `main` as the Release App.
GitHub Release publication uses the repository-scoped workflow token so it has a rate-limit quota
independent from the shared Release App installation.

## T3 Connect relay deployment

The relay is a shared control plane versioned separately from client releases. Stable and nightly
client builds must point at the same relay so users see the same linked environments when switching
release channels.

`.github/workflows/deploy-relay.yml` deploys Alchemy stage `prod` on every push to `main`. The
release workflow reads the relay URL and Clerk client configuration from the existing `production`
GitHub Actions environment before building desktop, CLI, or hosted web artifacts.

Required repository variables shared by relay deployments:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `PLANETSCALE_ORGANIZATION`
- `AXIOM_ORG_ID`

Required repository secrets shared by relay deployments:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN_ID`
- `PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN`
- `AXIOM_TOKEN`

Required `production` environment variables:

- `RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME`
- `RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME`
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`
- `CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `APNS_ENVIRONMENT`
- `APNS_TEAM_ID`
- `APNS_KEY_ID`
- `APNS_BUNDLE_ID`

Optional `production` environment variables:

- `RELAY_DOMAIN` when overriding the derived `relay.<RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME>` domain

Required `production` environment secrets:

- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`

The account-scoped repository credentials are consumed by Alchemy while provisioning relay stages; they
are not bound into the relay Worker. The production deployment uses an Axiom personal access token,
so `AXIOM_ORG_ID` must accompany `AXIOM_TOKEN`. The `prod` stage owns the retained PlanetScale
database. Local personal stages provision isolated branches from it and are never deployed by CI.
Production adopts the configured relay API and tunnel DNS zones as retained Cloudflare resources.
Personal stages reference the production-owned zones.

Developers deploy personal stages locally rather than through pull-request automation:

```sh
vp run --filter t3code-relay deploy -- --stage "$USER" --env-file .env.local
```

## GitHub release infrastructure

Configure the `production` GitHub environment with the relay and Clerk values above. Configure
these repository-level release credentials before running stable validation:

- Release GitHub App: `RELEASE_APP_ID` and `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`; the installation needs
  repository Contents read/write access so the workflow can create releases and finalize versions.
- Apple signing/notarization: the secrets and variables in the macOS section below.
- Azure Trusted Signing: the secrets in the Windows section below.
- Vercel: `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` for the dedicated project.

Discord secrets are optional. Both announcement steps use `continue-on-error`, so missing Discord
configuration cannot block a release.

## Hosted web app release deployment

The hosted app is intentionally not deployed by Vercel's Git integration. The
web project disables automatic Git deployments in `apps/web/vercel.ts` via
`git.deploymentEnabled: false`, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` deploys the
web app with Vercel CLI after the GitHub Release succeeds.

Required GitHub Actions secrets:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

Optional GitHub Actions variables:

- `VERCEL_TEAM_SLUG`: overrides the Vercel CLI scope when the team slug is preferred over the `VERCEL_ORG_ID` secret.
- `T3CODE_WEB_ROUTER_URL`: defaults to `https://awtprod-command-center.vercel.app`.

Required Vercel project:

- Project name: `awtprod-command-center`
- Production domain: `https://awtprod-command-center.vercel.app`
- Root directory: `apps/web`

The release deploy job rewrites package versions before upload so the About panel renders the
release version. Stable releases use a production deployment. Nightly releases use a preview
deployment and print its generated URL in the workflow summary. Because there are no fixed channel
aliases, hosted channel switching is hidden unless `VITE_HOSTED_APP_CHANNEL_SWITCHING=1` is supplied
for a future deployment strategy that supports it.

One-time Vercel dashboard setup:

1. Create or select `awtprod-command-center` and set its root directory to `apps/web`.
2. Record its project and organization IDs in the repository secrets above.
3. Disable automatic Git deployments in the dashboard if desired; the committed
   `vercel.ts` setting is the source-of-truth, but disconnecting Git in the
   dashboard is also safe.
4. Confirm the project production domain is `https://awtprod-command-center.vercel.app`.

## Nightly builds

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - scheduled check every three hours
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` with `channel=nightly`
- Runs the same desktop quality gates and artifact matrix as the tagged release flow.
- Publishes a GitHub prerelease only:
  - tag format: `nightly-vX.Y.Z-nightly.YYYYMMDD.<run_number>`
  - release name includes the short commit SHA
  - `make_latest` is always `false`
- Uses the next stable patch version as the nightly base. For example, `0.0.17` produces nightlies on `0.0.18-nightly.*`.
- Publishes Electron auto-update metadata to the dedicated `nightly` updater channel, so desktop users can opt into that track independently from stable.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `@awtprod/command-center`) to the `nightly` npm dist-tag using the same nightly version.
- Does not commit version bumps back to `main`.

## Server self-update release invariant

Connected servers update to the client's exact version, not to an npm dist-tag. Every released
desktop or hosted client version must therefore have a matching
`@awtprod/command-center@<version>` package available on npm before users can receive that client.

The workflow enforces this ordering:

1. `publish_cli` publishes the exact stable or nightly version to npm.
2. `release` depends on `publish_cli` before exposing desktop artifacts in GitHub Releases.
3. `deploy_web` depends on `release` before moving the hosted channel to the new client.

Preserve these dependencies when changing the release graph. Publishing a client first would leave
the **Update server** action targeting a package version that does not exist yet.

For a release smoke test, confirm `npm view @awtprod/command-center@<version> version` returns the expected version, then
connect the new client to a server on the previous version and verify that the update action
reconnects to the matching server. Use releases with identical migration manifests for the
automatic path. When the manifest changed, verify that the remote action stops before restart and
shows the exact local `npx @awtprod/command-center@<version> service update` command. Also test the manual or
desktop-managed guidance when those environments are available.

## Desktop auto-update notes

- Runtime updater: `electron-updater` in `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`.
- Update UX:
  - Background checks run on startup delay + interval.
  - No automatic download or install.
  - The desktop UI shows a rocket update button when an update is available; click once to download, click again after download to restart/install.
- Provider: GitHub Releases (`provider: github`) configured at build time.
- Repository slug source:
  - `T3CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`), if set.
  - otherwise `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` from GitHub Actions.
- Temporary private-repo auth workaround:
  - set `T3CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN`) in the desktop app runtime environment.
  - the app forwards it as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` request header for updater HTTP calls.
- Required release assets for updater:
  - platform installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, plus macOS `.zip` for Squirrel.Mac update payloads)
  - channel metadata: `latest*.yml` for stable releases, `nightly*.yml` for nightly releases
  - `*.blockmap` files (used for differential downloads)
- macOS metadata note:
  - `electron-updater` reads `latest-mac.yml` on stable and `nightly-mac.yml` on nightly, for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
  - The workflow merges the per-arch mac manifests into one channel-specific mac manifest before publishing the GitHub Release.

### Windows payload topology and update validation

Windows packages the bundled server and only its runtime-external/native
dependency closure in `resources/server.asar`. Native modules and helper
executables declared as unpacked by that archive must be present at the matching
paths below `resources/server.asar.unpacked`. The Windows-native backend reads
the archive in place through Electron. WSL cannot read ASAR files, so enabling
the WSL backend extracts the server tree once into the desktop state directory
under `wsl-server-tree/<version>` and reuses the completed version until the app
is updated.

The artifact builder rejects a Windows package when any of these invariants
break:

- `resources/server.asar` is absent or does not contain the server entry.
- Any file marked unpacked in the ASAR header is absent from
  `resources/server.asar.unpacked`.
- On same-architecture Windows builds, the packaged primary cannot load the fff
  native library from inside `server.asar` through its `.unpacked` sibling.
- The isolated, extracted sidecar cannot load the server entry with plain Node.
- The external Windows resource monitor is absent.
- The unpacked Windows application contains more than 80 files.

Cross-architecture Windows builds retain every structural and extracted-sidecar
check, but skip executing the target Electron binary. A same-architecture build
for each release target must exercise the primary native-load probe.

NSIS differential packaging remains enabled. A sidecar layout transition can
produce a larger one-time download; subsequent small releases retain their
blockmaps, with a 60 MB maximum for a representative sidecar-to-sidecar update.

## 0) npm OIDC trusted publishing setup (CLI)

The workflow publishes the CLI with `npm publish` from `apps/server` after bumping
the package version to the release tag version.

Checklist:

1. Create the public npm package `@awtprod/command-center` under the `awtprod` scope.
2. In npm package settings, configure Trusted Publisher:
   - Provider: GitHub Actions
   - Repository: this repo
   - Workflow file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Environment (if used): match your npm trusted publishing config
3. Ensure npm account and org policies allow trusted publishing for the package.
4. Create release tag `vX.Y.Z` and push; workflow will:
   - set `apps/server/package.json` version to `X.Y.Z`
   - build web + server
   - run `npm publish --access public --tag latest`
5. Nightly runs from the same workflow file publish with `npm publish --access public --tag nightly`.

## 1) Signed validation release

Use this before every stable publication. It performs the full signed build matrix but has no
publication side effects.

1. Open **Actions → Release → Run workflow**.
2. Select `mode=validate`, `channel=stable`, and enter the exact version (for v1, `1.0.0`).
3. Wait for every preflight, relay, signing, build, and artifact-validation job to pass.
4. Download the `command-center-<version>-validation` artifact.
5. Verify signatures, notarization, install/uninstall behavior, protocols, embedded backend startup,
   clean-profile functionality, SSH launch, persistence, and mock-server updater detection on every
   supported OS.
6. Only after acceptance passes, run the same version with `mode=publish`.

## 2) Apple signing + notarization setup (macOS)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_API_KEY`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`
- `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` (base64-encoded provisioning profile with Associated Domains)

Required repository variables:

- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Optional repository variables:

- `CLERK_PASSKEY_RP_DOMAINS`: comma-separated production Clerk RP domains. It is required by the
  stable release workflow so associated-domain intent is explicit.

Checklist:

1. Apple Developer account access:
   - Team has rights to create Developer ID certificates.
2. Create an explicit App ID for `com.awtprod.commandcenter` and enable Associated Domains.
3. Create a `Developer ID Application` certificate and a compatible provisioning profile for that
   App ID with Associated Domains enabled.
4. Export the certificate + private key as `.p12` from Keychain.
5. Base64-encode the `.p12` and store as `CSC_LINK`.
6. Base64-encode the provisioning profile and store it as `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`.
7. Store the `.p12` export password as `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, and set `APPLE_TEAM_ID` to the
   10-character Apple Developer Team ID.
8. In App Store Connect, create an API key (Team key).
9. Add API key values:
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`: contents of the downloaded `.p8`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: Key ID
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: Issuer ID
10. Complete the Clerk Native API and AASA setup in [T3 Connect Clerk Setup](../cloud/t3-connect-clerk.md#desktop-passkeys).
11. Run a stable validation and confirm macOS artifacts are signed/notarized and contain the expected
    `com.apple.developer.associated-domains` entitlement.

Notes:

- `APPLE_API_KEY` is stored as raw key text in secrets.
- The workflow writes it to a temporary `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file at runtime.
- The workflow decodes `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`, validates it with `security cms`, and passes it
  to the desktop packager.

## 3) Azure Trusted Signing setup (Windows)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`

Checklist:

1. Create Azure Trusted Signing account and certificate profile.
2. Record ATS values:
   - Endpoint
   - Account name
   - Certificate profile name
   - Publisher name
3. Create/choose an Entra app registration (service principal).
4. Grant service principal permissions required by Trusted Signing.
5. Create a client secret for the service principal.
6. Add Azure secrets listed above in GitHub Actions secrets.
7. Re-run a tag release and confirm Windows installer is signed.

## 4) Ongoing release checklist

1. Ensure `main` is green in CI.
2. Run `mode=validate` for the intended version and complete the clean-profile acceptance matrix.
3. Run `mode=publish` for the same version. A pushed stable tag also invokes publish mode, but the
   manual interface is preferred for the first release.
4. Verify workflow steps:
   - preflight passes
   - all matrix builds pass
   - release job uploads expected files
5. Smoke test downloaded artifacts.

## 5) Troubleshooting

- macOS build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Apple secrets plus `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are populated and non-empty.
  - Confirm the provisioning profile belongs to `APPLE_TEAM_ID.com.awtprod.commandcenter` and includes
    Associated Domains.
- Windows build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Azure ATS and auth secrets are populated and non-empty.
- Build fails with signing error:
  - Re-check certificate/profile names, associated domains, and tenant/client credentials. Stable
    validation and publication intentionally do not have an unsigned fallback.
